## About

We aspire to publish the best articles about privacy on the net. From hot-takes to long-form essays, we are looking for stylish and well-written pieces.

This not a place for sponsored content or SEO-obsessed posts. Please do **not** pitch us this, as we don't take kindly to it and your email will be blocked. *Caveat scriptor.*
